                        I believe AI should be more than just powerful algorithms—it should be a tool to make life better, more accessible, and more humane. To me, AI is not about replacing people, but about amplifying what we can do, helping us solve problems we couldn’t tackle alone.
<br>
One idea I’ve been passionate about is using AI to support the training of service animals, opening up new ways to improve accessibility and independence for people who need it most. Projects like this reflect what drives me: applying technology in creative, human-centered ways.
<br>
My background spans artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mobile and web development, with a foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and C. Now, as a graduate student in computer science focusing on AI, I’m continuing to explore how research and innovation can turn bold ideas into practical systems.
<br>
I’m excited to connect with others who share the belief that technology should not only advance what’s possible, but also what’s meaningful.

                                <br>&#8226;&emsp;Collaborated to develop a text-based game enabling users to tailor
                                their own player characters
                                <br>&#8226;&emsp;Developed a text-based game using Java, leveraging object-oriented
                                programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to
                                create modular and reusable code. Applied software design patterns, including MVC
                                (Model-View-Controller), to structure the game's architecture, enabling efficient
                                interaction between the graphical user interface and the backend logic. This approach
                                ensured maintainability, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns within the
                                game.
                                <br>&#8226;&emsp;Packaged the project as an executable (.exe) file, leading to a
