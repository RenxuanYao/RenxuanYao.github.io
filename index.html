                    <p class="text">
                        As a computer science major, I have a passion for technology and a drive to make a difference in
                        the world. I was working as the leader of the coding club at my university, where I am
                        responsible for managing a team of developers and overseeing the development of a website. This
                        experience has taught me valuable leadership skills and given me hands-on experience with web
                        development.<br>
                        In addition to my experience with web development, I also have a strong understanding of
                        artificial intelligence and android development. I have worked on several projects involving
                        machine learning, and have a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and
                        C. I am always eager to learn new technologies and expand my knowledge in the field of computer
                        science.

                                <br><em>Jan. 2024 – May. 2024</em>
                                <br>&#8226;&emsp;Collaborated to develop a text-based game enabling users to tailor
                                their own player characters
                                <br>&#8226;&emsp;Developed a text-based game using Java, leveraging object-oriented
                                programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to
                                create modular and reusable code. Applied software design patterns, including MVC
                                (Model-View-Controller), to structure the game's architecture, enabling efficient
                                interaction between the graphical user interface and the backend logic. This approach
                                ensured maintainability, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns within the
                                game.
                                <br>&#8226;&emsp;Packaged the project as an executable (.exe) file, leading to a
                                complete text-based game experience
