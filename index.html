          <hr>
          <p class="text">
            As a computer science major, I have a passion for technology and a drive to make a difference in the world. I was working as the leader of the coding club at my university, where I am responsible for managing a team of developers and overseeing the development of a website. This experience has taught me valuable leadership skills and given me hands-on experience with web development.<br>
            In addition to my experience with web development, I also have a strong understanding of artificial intelligence and android development. I have worked on several projects involving machine learning, and have a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C. I am always eager to learn new technologies and expand my knowledge in the field of computer science.
